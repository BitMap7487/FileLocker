<!-- About The Project -->
## About The Project

The FileLocker project is a robust file protection application designed to safeguard your important files. It offers a range of powerful features to ensure your data's privacy and security. Whether you want to simply hide files, encrypt them, or even secure the binary files, FileLocker has you covered.

### Features

- **Hide Files:** FileLocker can make all files within its directory invisible and inaccessible through regular file explorers.

- **EncryptBinFile:** This feature encrypts the entire binary file containing the file binaries, ensuring that even if someone tries to access the binary file directly, the contents remain secure and unreadable without the correct password.

- **Change Password:** Easily modify the password used to lock and unlock the hidden files for enhanced security.

## How to Use

FileLocker provides a straightforward user interface with the following key features:

<!-- Settings -->
## Settings

FileLocker offers three settings to customize your file protection preferences:

- **Strictly Hide Files:** Select this option to only hide the files within the directory without encrypting them. The files remain in their original state.

- **Hide and Encrypt Files:** This option not only hides the selected files but also encrypts them using a secure encryption algorithm, providing a higher level of security for your sensitive data.

- **EncryptBinFile:** By choosing this option, FileLocker encrypts the entire binary file containing the file binaries, ensuring the contents remain secure and unreadable without the correct password.

<!-- Security Reminder -->
## Security Reminder

Remember to keep your password secure and avoid sharing it with unauthorized individuals. If you forget your password, it might be impossible to recover the hidden files, especially if they are encrypted. So, always keep a backup of important files outside of FileLocker if needed.

Enjoy using FileLocker to protect your valuable files and maintain your privacy!
